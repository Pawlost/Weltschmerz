## About the project

Weltschmerz is C# world generator library for any platform.

World planner for Terra. Generates various maps which are then combined into a high level representation of a world map. Weltschmerz is the architect who doesn't get his hands dirty.

Weltschmerz is world generater for [Rituals  of the old](https://www.ritualsoftheold.com/) game developed in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the library for development. See build for notes on how to build the dll library for your project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

#### Windows

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) with *.NET Desktop development* and *Universal Windows Platform Develpment*

#### Linux
To be added

#### Both

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.

* [Config file](https://github.com/starandserpent/Weltschmerz/blob/master/config/config.conf) in your repositiory

* [C# Hocon library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hocon.Configuration/) project reference in your .csproj file

```
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Hocon.Configuration">
      <Version>2.0.3</Version>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

```

### Installation
A step by step series how to install library into your project

#### As git submodule
* Go to your project folder
* Initialize git in your repository (if it is not already initialize)
```git
git init
```
* Add Weltschmerz as git submodule
```git
git submodule add git@github.com:starandserpent/Weltschmerz.git --recusive
```
* Include .cs files from Weltschmerz in your project

#### As .dll library
* Open Weltschmerz in Visual Studio 2019
* Build solution
* Open your project
* Add builded library as reference


## Usage
When you initialize main Weltschmerz class you can then access all possible generated values from this class
```csharp
Weltschmerz weltschmerz = new Weltschmerz();
double elevation = weltschmerz.GetElevation(0, 0);
```

If you want to use replace any weltschmerz generator you can use abstract class
```csharp
    weltschmerz.ElevationGenerator = new Elevation();
```

You can load your custom config file
```csharp
    string path = "yourpath/to/file"
    Config config = ConfigManager.GetConfig(path);
```


For further implementation as library in 3D game see [Voxel-demo](https://github.com/starandserpent/Voxel-demo) or as map generator [World-map-generator](https://github.com/starandserpent/World-map-generator)
